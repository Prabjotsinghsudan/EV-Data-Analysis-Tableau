# EV-Data-Analysis-Tableau
A comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data using Tableau. This project explores market trends, technological advancements, and geographic distribution of BEVs and PHEVs. Visualizations include vehicle growth patterns, state-wise distribution, top manufacturers, and CAFV eligibility.
Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data to understand market dynamics, technological advancements, and distribution trends. Using Tableau, key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations have been created to provide insights into BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) data.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Vehicles: Overall count of BEVs and PHEVs.
Average Electric Range: Average range of electric vehicles.
Total BEV Vehicles: Number of BEVs and their percentage relative to the total number of EVs.
Total PHEV Vehicles: Number of PHEVs and their percentage relative to the total number of EVs.
Charts and Visualizations
Total Vehicles by Model Year: Analyzes growth patterns from 2010.
Total Vehicles by State: Shows the geographic distribution of EVs.
Top 10 Vehicles by Make: Identifies the leading manufacturers in the EV market.
Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: Highlights vehicles eligible for incentives.
Top 10 Vehicles by Model: Lists the most popular EV models.
